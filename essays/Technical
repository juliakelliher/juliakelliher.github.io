I had a good idea of what to do for BrowserHistory1, but I couldn’t get it finished within the DNF time, and even after I did, it wasn’t working correctly. I went to the screencast and followed along before I could do it on my own. It took me over 40 minutes to finish this WOD because I had to keep going back to the screencast. When I finally got it down, it only took me about 19 minutes to finish it. I had an easier time with BrowserHistory2 because I had the code from the first one and only needed to add in headers and a style sheet. It took me closer to 20 minutes to finish this one before I watched the screencast, then it took under 9 minutes. This one was a lot easier to do since I took more time completing BrowserHistory1 with the screencasts.
It is a lot easier to take the time to get through and learn the WODs than just copying and pasting the code for them to work. It is worth it to put the time in since we have to use these skills for everything else we’re doing in the class and are already expected to know on our own.
