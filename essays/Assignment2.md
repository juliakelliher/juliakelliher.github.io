We had to create a website that processed and stored user login and registration data with user information validation.

I worked with Nick Ashikawa who contributed about 60% of this project. I contributed about the other 40%.
We ended up emailing Professor Port and meeting with him in his office for the questions we had. In the beginning, we attempted to just search online for our problems, but that wasn't the most effective way of finding answers. We spent about 20% of the time thinking about how to do something, 20% of the time writing code, and about 60% of the time testing and debugging. Part way through, we were actually running the wrong server and weren't able to load the registration page. We had a problem with our registration page once with password matching. We had written an alert in the registration.html file in addition to the one in the server, and the wrong alert was popping up on the client. Once we remedied this problem, we had stressed over a very simple mistake in naming the repeated password variable different than the one that was being requested, so the passwords were alerting as different when they were actually typed in the same. We ended up going through the code of each file a few times to make sure variables matched up and that the necessary parts were there. It was definitely necessary for us to work together in person because many things get lost in translation over text and email or looking over each other's githubs.

We started asking for help way too late, and the problems we had ended up being fairly easy to solve. Half of the time our variables were just named differently or in the wrong places in a file. We also assumed we could finish this assignment in a similar time frame to assignment 1, but it ended up taking much more time. For assignment 4 we will definitely be dedicating more time so we can ask more questions.
